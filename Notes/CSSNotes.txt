Create divs to sepereate "blocks" of content from one another

Create Classes to apply changes to entire groups of content
 - Utilize margin left & right auto to center content
  + must have a width attribute, and display block as well to create centering
 - Utilize padding to create space between div "block" and content within div
 - Utilize border and border radius to create border around content

Try not to use pure black and white on pages, creates unpleasing look, instead use hex values that are ligther/darker

Utilize the Box Model:Organize placement of content around these elements:
- Margin: Seperating edges of div from page/ one another
- Border: Essentially space div takes up
- Padding: Area around content
- Content 

Use line-height instead of height

Can also Center content using text-align:center; in main div of webpage
- This method is used to center content within the div of main "block"
 + tell contianer all inline elements should align to the center

Can Also center content using a flex-box = (display: flex;)
 - Flexbox always consinst of a contianer and its children
  + must wrap content around div tag and children classe below will have atrribute applied
 - To use create a css element for your div, then state
 {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
 }
  + This will place everything in line and center it as well
 - To seperate items within same inline of flexbox either add margin to left & right of item or chagne value 
 of justify content to space-around to evenly distribute space around items

Browsers will automatically format some aspects of the css with a built in style stylesheet
 -If you do not specify attributes some will automatically be given

 For HTML filepaths 
- use ../ to go one level up
- use / to go to the root folder
- use filename.type if the file is located in the current folder
- use filefolder/filename.type if the file is located in the filefolder in the current folder

Flexbox takes everychild of a parent div and turns it into a column
 - However, it only effects direct children, so "grandchildren" will not be effected
 - So if you want to seperate the application of flexbox attributes, create divs for elements you 
 want to be affected

A utility class is a class that only sets a single css property
 - give the html attribute the class name of the utility class, then
 in the css file create an attribute with name of utility, and provide it with
 one attribute
 - Allows you to apply the attribute of that class to any html tag, without having to edit each 
  individuals tags class

You can have more than one class for an html element
- To do so put a space between each class name for the html element

Justify Spacing is as follows
- space-around = space before, between, and after items
- space-evenly = items will have equal space around them
- space-between = itesm will ahve space between them

Flexbox Containers by defualt are display block

The power of inheritance is the ability to write DRYer code
 - Certain properties can be inhreted by children of the body tag, 
  this can prevent reptition of things such as text-align center
 - Only certain properties can be inherted
 - Feels similar to utility classes

Web Safe fonts can remove the necessity of server sending font information to client
